# ComboLock
This is a homework problem from the book "Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++" by Michael Main and Walter Savitch.
This is Chapter Two Problem One of the fourth edition of the book.


1.Specify, desgin, and implement a class that can be used in a program that simulates a combination lock. The lock has a circular knob, with the numbers 0 trhough 39 marked on the edge, and it has three-number combination, which we'll call x,y,z. To open teh lock, you must turn the knob clockwise at least one entire revolution, stopping with x at the top; then turn the knob counter-clockwise, stopping the second time that y appears at the top; finally turn the knob clockwise again, stopping the next time that z appears at the top. At this point, you open the lock.
   Your lock class shouldd have a constructor that initializes the three-number combination (use 0,0,0 for default arguments). Also provide member functions:
    (a) to alter the lock's combination to a new three-number combination
    (b) to turn the knob in a given direction until a specified number appears at the top
    (c) to close the lock
    (d) to attempt to open the lock
    (e) to inquire about the status of the lock (open or shut)
    (f) to tell you what number it is currently at the top
